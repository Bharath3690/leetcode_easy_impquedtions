In this tournament, when a team loses, they are eliminated and will no longer play any matches.
There are n teams, and 1 winner. Thus, n - 1 teams will be eliminated.
Each match is played between two teams. One team wins, one team loses. Thus, each match eliminates exactly one team.
As n - 1 teams will be eliminated, there will be n - 1 matches played, with each match eliminating a team.
Algorithm
Return n - 1.
